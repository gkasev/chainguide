# The Chain Guide
A [search engine](http://thechainguide.net/) for the bycicle enthusiast. Come join me (us, hopefully some day)!

## Community-Curated Search Engine Index
All pages indexed by this search engine are manually added by members of our community. To add a page, simply insert the url in the appropriate index file. There is one index file for each category: techinfo, reviews, stories and products. Currently only the techinfo category is live.

## How To Submit a Page for Indexing
You can submit pages by email ( add(at)thechainguide.net ) or by creating a pull request on the index file.

## What to Index
Submit pages that represent the final destination for the user. For example, submit this specific [product page](https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/skewers/quick-release-seat-post-collar/), instead of the intermediate [product category page](https://www.paulcomp.com/product-category/components/skewers/). 

## How to start?
docker-compose up --build -d
