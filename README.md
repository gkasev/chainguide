## Community-Curated Index
All pages indexed by this search engine are manually added by members of our community. You are welcome to join us! To add a page, simply insert its url in the appropriate index file. There is one index file for each category: techinfo, reviews, stories and products. Currently only the techinfo category is live.

## How To
You can submit pages by email at add(at)thechainguide.net or by creating a pull request.

## What to Index
Submit pages that represent the final destination for an interested user. For example, submit the page of a specific product, like https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/skewers/quick-release-seat-post-collar/, instead of an intermediate page of the product category - https://www.paulcomp.com/product-category/components/skewers/.
