# The Chain Guide
A [search engine](http://thechainguide.net/) for bycicle enthusiasts. Come join me (us, hopefully some day)!

## Community-Curated Search Engine Index
All pages indexed by this search engine are manually added by members of our community. To add a page, simply insert the url in the appropriate index file. There is one index file for each category: techinfo, reviews, stories and products. Currently only the techinfo category is live.

## How To Submit a Page for Indexing
You can submit pages by email (add(at)thechainguide.net) or by creating a pull request on the appropriate index file.

## What to Index
Submit pages that represent the final destination for an interested user. For example, submit the page of a specific product, like https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/skewers/quick-release-seat-post-collar/, instead of an intermediate page of the product category - https://www.paulcomp.com/product-category/components/skewers/.
